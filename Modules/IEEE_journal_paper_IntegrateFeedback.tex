\subsection*{Proposed architecture}
Similar to time-domain direct-form IIR filter design, which relies on feeding back the filter's recursive part with a combination of delayed instances of its output (see Figure \ref{fig:IIR_feedbachArch}), our approach relies on spatial feedback of received array signals back to the transmitter.

In order to do so, we propose a dual beam-former architecture (see Figure \ref{fig:Proposed_spatialIIR_ARCH}), defined by two sets of spatial weights $\vecnot{\alpha},\vecnot{\beta}$, generating two independently spatially filtered signals $\vecnot{\alpha}^{T}\Steer{\theta_{g}},\vecnot{\beta}^{T}\Steer{\theta_{g}}$. One is the system's output and the other is fed back to the medium using a transmitting antenna.
