\subsection*{Proposed architecture}
Similar to time-domain direct-form IIR filter design, which relies on feeding back the filter's recursive part with a combination of delayed instances of its output (see Figure \ref{fig:IIR_feedbachArch}), our approach relies on spatial feedback of received array signals back to the transmitter.

In order to do so, we propose a dual beam-former architecture (see Figure \ref{fig:Proposed_spatialIIR_ARCH}), defined by two sets of spatial weights $\vecnot{\alpha},\vecnot{\beta}$, generating two independently spatially filtered signals $\vecnot{\alpha}^{T}\Steer{\theta_{g}},\vecnot{\beta}^{T}\Steer{\theta_{g}}$. One is the system's output and the other is fed back to the medium using a transmitting antenna.

\section{Performance of array processing with feedback}
In this section we analkyze some of the frundamental properties of an array; it's beamwidth and it's peak to a sidelobe level. As we show, by integrating the feedback, we can obtain performance much better than the classic  beamforming. We analyze the performance for general manifold, and then show the obtained results for a ULA.

\subsection*{Phase alignment sensitivity}
Although (\ref{eqn_arrayPerformance_beamwidth_fullEpxr})'s high sensitivity (see (\ref{eqn_arrayPerformance_beamwidth_approx})) to $\dTheta$ expresses the desirable ``sharp`` spatial IIR beampattern, it's high sensitivity to $\dTau$, as will be demonstrated, states that only target which reside in a very impractically specific range (i.e. $\tau$) will be enhanced. To evaluate the necessary accuracy, we compare $\Hr{\theta}{\tau}{2}$ to $2$, while setting $\dTheta=0$ (i.e. perfectly steered array). It follows that $$\frac{r}{\left|1-\rho\right|^{2}}\dTau^{2} = 1,$$ i.e. only a very small range interval $\Delta{R} \triangleq \frac{\dTau}{2\pi{}\lambda}$ is amplified. Setting typical physical parameters (both in RF or acoustic environments) result in $\Delta{R} \propto 10^{-4}_{\left[m\right]}$ which is obviously impractical, considering array ambiguity, signal modeling errors, range estimation errors etc.
