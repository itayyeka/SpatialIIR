In this work we will investigate and develop methods of choosing the coefficients $ \vecnot{\alpha} $ and $ \vecnot{\beta} $ when a desired beam-pattern, $ H_{d}(\theta)$, is to be approximated. We will examine the outcome of partial knowledge of the propagation delays $\tau_{pd},\tau_{tx}$ and their influence on the stability of the filter. Another possible direction of research is to consider a more realistic reverberant channels which are common in acoustical environments, rather than the simple one-tap channel presented here. Simulations of dynamic spatial filtering of multi-speakers will be presented and compared to other conventional methods such as the classical delay and sum beam-former. Finally, we intend to implement the above suggested system.
