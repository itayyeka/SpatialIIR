Assume a far field source with signal $x(t)$. 
The resulting wavefront, with direction of arrival (DOA) $\theta$, is received by an array. 
We assume a ULA, with elements spacing $d$. A weight and sum beamformer, with weights $\beta_n,\;n=0,...,N-1$  is used to retransmit the signal back to the source point. 
The retransmission can be conducted after RF modulation, or possibly acoustically, in the context of acoustical signal processing. 
As this cooperative source has a transponder, the obtained feedback signal, together with its own source signal $x(t)$ are summed up, and collected again by the array. 
A weight and sum beam-former, with weights $\alpha_n,\;n=0,...,N-1$ is used prior to generating the final output signal $y(t)$.
