Uniform linear array (ULA) processing in the spatial domain is similar to time domain finite-impulse-response (FIR) filtering (e.g. \cite{van1988beamforming}).
The similarity arises because temporal FIR's input is composed of equally time-spaced samples and the ULA's input is obtained from equally spatially-spaced samples of the impinging wavefront.
Both temporal FIR and ULA filtering assign weights to each sample in order to achieve a desired temporal/spatial response.
From time domain filter design theory, it is well known that infinite impulse response (IIR) filters attain certain advantages over FIR filtering.
