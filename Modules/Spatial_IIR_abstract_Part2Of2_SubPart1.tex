A natural question to consider is ``what is the array structure in spatial domain which is analogous to IIR filtering in the time domain?''.
The motivation for finding an IIR equivalent in the spatial domain is obvious:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{
Increased degrees of freedom over conventional array processing to control the array response.
}
\item
{
Substantially lower number of taps (smaller number of array elements and reduced array aperture) is required for obtaining a desired response in comparison to an FIR based design. This, naturally, results in cost-efficient array.
}
\end{itemize}
