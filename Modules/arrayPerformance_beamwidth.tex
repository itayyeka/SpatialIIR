A commonly used parameter for quantifying the narrowness of the array main lobe is the Half-Power-Beam-Width (HPBW), marking the DOA where the beampattern's energy reduces to half of its maximal value (i.e. $\abs{\Hr}^2=\frac{1}{2}$). 
\par For standard ULA, it is known \cite{VanTrees2002DetectionIV} that for large $N$,
$$
 \frac{\lambda\dTheta_{\text{HPBW}}}{2\pi{}d} = \frac{\lambda}{\pi{}Nd}1.4,
$$
where $\lambda$ is the signal wavelength, and $\dTheta_{\text{HPBW}}/2$ is the electrical angle where the HPBW is obtained. Note that $Nd$ is the array aperture size. Thus, for the classical ULA configuration, assuming $N\gg 1$, we have $N\dTheta_{\text{HPBW}}/2= 1.4$.
\par In App.~\ref{apdx_HPBW} we extend this known result for any $r\geq 0$. It turns out that for large $N$, the HPBW is obtained by solving the equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq_HPBW}
    % \resizebox{1\linewidth}{!}{
        \begin{split}
            \rBrace{r^{2}-4r+2}\frac{\sin{\rBrace{x}}^{2}}{x^{2}}+r\frac{\sin{\rBrace{2x}}}{x}-1=0
        \end{split}
    % }
\end{equation}
where we define $x\triangleq{} N\dTheta/2$. In Fig.~\ref{fig_feedbackULA_HPBW_Nx_vs_N_variousR} we plot the numerical solution of \eqref{eq_HPBW} for various values of $r$ and $N$, showing that $x$ reaches its limit already for $N>20$. Also note that for $r=0$ we obtain the known result of classical ULA with the limiting factor of $1.4$.
Having the limiting factors for various values of gain mismatch $r$, we investigate the improvement due to the feedback.
Specifically, we can approximate the HPBW by
\[
\dTheta_{\text{HPBW}}/2\approx \frac{1}{B(r)N}
\]
% where $B(r)=1/\rBrace{1-r}\rBrace{-0.4r+1.4}$ is the second order polynomial approximation of the limiting values.
where $B(r)$ represent the array aperture improvement factor (compared to the classical ULA), due to the feedback. By fitting a second order polynomial,
 $B(r)$ may be approximated as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq_Bapprox}
    B(r)\approx\frac{1}{\rBrace{1-r}\rBrace{-0.4r+1.4}}.
\end{equation} 
This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig_feedbackULA_beamwidth_limit_r_dependent}. 
Note that large $B(r)$ implies that the suggested feedback based system, has smaller HPBW. Alternatively, to obtain similar HPBW, the classical ULA must have an aperture size $B$-times larger.
As evident from \eqref{eq_Bapprox} and Fig.~\ref{fig_feedbackULA_beamwidth_limit_r_dependent}, we thus conclude that with gain mismatch factor $r$ close to unity, the implication is that the HPBW is equivalent to classical ULA with infinite aperture size.
